 *
 * A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
 * exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles
 * is a tree.
 * 
 * Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1
 * edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge
 * between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the
 * tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has
 * height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e.
 * min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 * 
 * Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any
 * order.
 * 
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward
 * path between the root and a leaf.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
 * Output: [1]
 * Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node
 * with label 1 which is the only MHT.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
 * Output: [3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * ai != bi
 * All the pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
 * The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated
 * edges.
