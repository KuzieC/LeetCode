#
# The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A',
# 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
# 
# 
# For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
# 
# 
# When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the
# DNA.
# 
# Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the
# 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA
# molecule. You may return the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
# Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
# Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
