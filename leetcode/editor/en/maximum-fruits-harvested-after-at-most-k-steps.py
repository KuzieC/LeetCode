#
# Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a
# 2D integer array fruits where fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti] depicts
# amounti fruits at the position positioni. fruits is already sorted by
# positioni in ascending order, and each positioni is unique.
# 
# You are also given a#printn integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are
# at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left
# or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk
# at most k k in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the
# fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.
# 
# Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
# Output: 9
# Explanation: 
# The optimal way is to:
# - Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
# - Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
# You moved 3 k and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
# Output: 14
# Explanation: 
# You can move at most k = 4 k, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
# The optimal way is to:
# - Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
# - Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
# - Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
# - Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
# You moved 1 + 3 = 4 k and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# You can move at most k = 2 k and cannot reach any position with
# fruits.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5
# fruits[i].length == 2
# 0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2 * 10^5
# positioni-1 < positioni for any i > 0Â (0-indexed)
# 1 <= amounti <= 10^4
# 0 <= k <= 2 * 10^5
#
